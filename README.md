# Crime-Prediction-using-ML
This is a project based on Crime Prediction using Machine Learning Agorithms

- The trend of total IPC crimes in every state for the next 9 years will be identified using ARIMA model.
- This forecasting technique will help law enforcement to examine the trend of crimes in every state in India. 
- Cities of the top worst state affected will be clustered according to the crimes committed.
